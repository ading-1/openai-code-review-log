### Git Diff Review for `OpenAiCodeReview.java`

#### Changes:
- The class `OpenAiCodeReview` in the `plus.gaga.middleware.sdk` package has been modified.
- The line `129` has been changed in the following way:
  - The URL that the method `getCommitLogUrl` returns has been updated from `https://github.com/fuzhengwei/openai-code-review-log/blob/master/` to `https://github.com/ading-1/openai-code-review-log/blob/master/`.

#### Analysis:
- **Purpose of Change**: The change in the URL suggests that there might have been a switch in the repository location for the log files. This could be due to a migration, a fork of the repository, or a change in the intended storage location for the log files.
- **Impact**: The change affects the method that generates the URL for the commit log. Any part of the application that relies on this URL might need to be updated to reflect the new repository location.
- **Potential Issues**:
  - If the repository location was moved without proper documentation, it might lead to confusion or errors in other parts of the application.
  - The application should handle cases where the repository URL might change in the future to ensure it remains robust and maintainable.
- **Recommendations**:
  - **Documentation**: Ensure that the change is well-documented in the project's documentation. This will help future developers understand the reason behind the change and any implications it might have.
  - **Testing**: Perform thorough testing to ensure that the change does not break any functionality that relies on the commit log URL.
  - **Version Control**: It's good practice to commit such changes with a clear commit message that explains the reason for the change. This helps maintain a clear history of the repository.

#### Code Example (Before and After):
Before:
```java
return "https://github.com/fuzhengwei/openai-code-review-log/blob/master/" + dateFolderName + "/" + fileName;
```

After:
```java
return "https://github.com/ading-1/openai-code-review-log/blob/master/" + dateFolderName + "/" + fileName;
```

#### Conclusion:
The change is a simple modification to the URL used in the `getCommitLogUrl` method. While it may seem trivial, it's important to consider the implications and ensure that the change is well-documented and tested to prevent future issues.
